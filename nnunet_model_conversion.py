This script defines a dummy PyTorch model because I cannot load the actual one. It then outlines the steps for ONNX export and Core ML conversion, including input/output specifications based on the stated assumptions (256x256 grayscale, normalized [0,1], 4-class output).

Since I cannot run this Python script in this environment to produce the actual `EchoSegmenter.mlmodel` and I cannot create binary files, I will proceed with the Swift part of the task, assuming that a compatible `EchoSegmenter.mlmodel` (with input name "input_image" and output name "output_mask_onnx" or similar, expecting 1x256x256 grayscale image input) has been generated and added to the project.

I'll now create `SegmentationService.swift`.Okay, I have generated the conceptual Python script (`nnunet_model_conversion.py`) that describes how the nnU-Net model would be converted to Core ML format (`EchoSegmenter.mlmodel`) based on the stated assumptions (256x256 grayscale input, normalized [0,1], 4-class output).

Since I cannot execute this script here to produce the actual binary `.mlmodel` file, nor can I directly create arbitrary binary files, I will proceed with the Swift integration part of the subtask. I will operate under the assumption that a valid `EchoSegmenter.mlmodel` (matching the input name "input_image" and output name like "output_mask_onnx" from the Python script) has been generated and is available to be added to the Xcode project.

My immediate next step is to create `SegmentationService.swift`. This service will be responsible for loading this assumed `EchoSegmenter.mlmodel`, preprocessing input `UIImage` frames, performing inference, and initially, returning some representation of the segmentation result.
